# Introduction
Welcome to AI Studio! The no-code AI development platform designed by SparkCognition Labs. 

AI Studio makes it easy to build, test, and deploy AI applications for any use case. With AI Studioâ€™s drag-and-drop interface, users can quickly assemble NLP and LLM pipelines to create content, analyze data, and automate repetitive tasks.

AI Studio is organized into three sections:

* NLP Palette: This is where users can assemble powerful NLP pipelines to clean, manipulate, analyze, and visualize text and tabular datasets. 
* LLM Palette: This environment is built on top of open-source framework and enables users to build dynamic LLM applications to automate operations and generate content
* Templates: AI Studio comes prepackaged with two template LLM pipelines: Document Q&A (where users can train LLMs on their own data) and Smart Bot (an LLM Agent that can search the internet). Users can also build custom pipelines and save them as templates for future use. 

AI Studio allows anyone to create dynamic applications using the latest AI components. Over the next few months, we will be rolling out new LLM agents, models, tools, and vector stores to dramatically expand the functionality of the platform. Please use our to monitor releases, ask questions, and provide feedback!
