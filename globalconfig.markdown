# Global Config

The global config modal allows the user to manage their external credentials in one place.
This includes API KEYs and S3 Config buckets. Currently we support integrations with:
* Open AI: State of the Art managed LLM
* Serp API: Scrape google search results
* AWS S3: Cloud-hosted file storage to manage your pipeline and document files
